:information_source: **About this server** :information_source:  
This is a friendly community geared towards getting as many new people as possible to start raiding. 
We provide structured guidance sometimes (the School Bus), but even outside of that, everyone should be able to find a group here, regardless of experience levels. 
Enjoy and have fun!

:question: **Are you a Newbie** :question:   
If you are new to the world of raiding, check #resources for some basic tutorials and then ask if there is a bus going in #raid-recruitment or wait around until someone hosts one. 
If no buses are starting soon, you can ask a regular group to take you along, but then it's your own job to learn the ropes for yourself. 

:question: **Are you a Veteran** :question:  
Help is always appreciated! If you meet the requirements and are cool with helping out newbies and don't mind them joining your raids, pm a moderator to get your vet role. See #info 


:bangbang: **Server Rules** :bangbang:  
:one: **Nicknaming**  
Your have to include your IGN in brackets behind your discord username, like this: `Steve (MLGProSteve)`  
Alternatively, set your discord name to be the same as your IGN, like this: `MLGProSteve`  
*(hint: you can change your username for this server and still have your regular one on other servers by right-clicking on your name in a text channel)*

:two: **Don't be a dick (bannable offense)**  
It is perfectly clear what kinds of infractions this covers, and moderators will quote rule 2 when dispensing warnings and bans. 

:three: **Politics, religion, NSFW, spam and insults are all unacceptable topics on this server.**  
Take it to private messages if you insist. 

:four: **Respect our team**  
They are working hard to make sure you have a nice place to find raids.

:five: **Channel naming conventions**  
When renaming your temporary channels (see #botspam on how to get those) keep "Chat, Raid, Speedrun or Raid Bus" in the title!

:whitespace: 
:six: **Do your best not to discriminate against newbies in raids**  
See "raid etiquette" in #info 

:seven: **Always use the appropriate channels**  
See #info and individual channel descriptions for more details

:eight: **Avoid getting warnings!**  
Breaking rules gets you a private warning PM, after that a public 'Warned' role and finally a kick!

:nine: **Follow the Server Etiquette!**  
You can find it in #info 

If you have any question, feel free to ask one of the moderators!
